## Ramotion Folding Cell {N} Plugin

A plugin to bring the exceptional work of [Ramotion](https://ramotion.com/) into the {N} platform.

PaperOnboarding is a material design slider. 

As [Ramotion](https://ramotion.com/) is as **forward thinking** as they are **super cool & talented**, they open sourced it which allows us to make it available to the {N} community.

PaperOnboarding Source for the [iOS Platform](https://github.com/Ramotion/paper-onboarding)

PaperOnboarding Source for the [Android Platform](https://github.com/Ramotion/paper-onboarding-android)

## Issues

>Flooding the native implementations repo with {N} specific implementation problems is discourteous.

Please create issues [here](https://github.com/DeviantJS/nativescript-paper-onboarding/issues) first and only after it has been properly vetted to not be an {N} specific implementation problem
should you open an issue in the [PaperOnboarding GitHub repo](https://github.com/Ramotion/paper-onboarding/issues).
